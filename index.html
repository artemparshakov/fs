            <p>Saleen states that the FourSixteen is more aerodynamic than the original. It also has improved cooling and a more track-friendly chassis, with several enhancements including a different sway bar and a software update that Saleen says improves cornering response and drivability.
            The FourSixteen packs the same 416 horsepower rating as the Model S. However, thanks to an all-new 11.39:1 final gear ratio, the car is noticeably quicker and a bit louder. It also has larger wheels and upgraded brakes including an optional carbon ceramic disc system.
            The interior also received upgraded interior components, but Saleen seeming removed some of the Model S’s seats. Saleen calls the FourSixteen a “four-seat supercar” with front and rear bucket seats, where the Model S sports a rear bench seat and two rear-facing seats in the back compartment.
            Pricing starts at $152,000, which, mercifully, includes the cost of the base P85Model S sedan. The company is taking orders now, but the vehicles take 6-8 weeks for delivery.</p>
